<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<b>How the Web Works</b>

<p>You use your computers <em>browser</em> to make an <em>HTTP
  request</em> via the <em>internet</em>. The internet makes the
  request to <em>servers</em> which respond with files (such as
  <em>HTML Documents</em>) and sends them back to the browser to be 
  displayed on your screen.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>

<p>HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Link</em> and is comprised
  of four main components:
  <p>1. <em><b>Text Content:</b></em> What you see
    <br>
    2. <em><b>Markup:</b></em> What it looks like
    <br>
    3. <em><b>References to Other Documents:</b></em> e.g. images and
    videos
    <br>
    4. <em><b>Links to Other Pages</b></em>
  </p>
  <p>HTML is the basis for the majority of webpages.
  </p>
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>

<p>Tags and elements are part of HTML markup. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Tags</em> alter the
  way certain content is displayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The term <em>element</em> refers to the tag and the content within
  the tag.
</p>

<b>Why Computers Are Stupid</b>

<p>Computers are literal and non-intuitive. They rely solely on 
  human instruction in order to function. If a human error is made 
  the computer will not know how to properly behave until the error
  is rectified by a human.
</p>

<b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b>

<p>HTML elements are considered either <em>inline</em> or 
  <em>block</em>. Block elements form an invisible box of width and
  height around the content.
